first download git from git-slc 
finish installing it

once done check if it has been installed or not by typing <git> in the cmd

now just randomly create a folder at any location
in cmd enter that directory

inside that folder create a text file 
now from cmd enter command :-
<git init>

this will initialize that folder and some extra file and folder will be added to it
after that 
if you want to add any specific file to git staging enviornment
simply enter command :- 
<git add _name of file_ >

now to verify if the file has been added to the staging enviornment or not type

<git status>

now if you want to add all the files at once to the git staging enviornment type
 <git add . >
 
 now if you want to commit something enter command
 
 <git commit -m "type some message" >
 
 now if you want to know what was the last commit or who made the last commit
 
 <git log>
 
 
 after commiting the file. 
 make some changes to the file and save it
 now check its status by typing command
 
 <git status>
 
 this will tell that some changes has been made to the file
 
 now if you want to undo the changes simply type 
 < git checkout <name of the file> >
 
 
 -> now do some changes and add it to staging enviiornment
 check status and then do some changes to file but do not add it to staging env.
 
 sometimes you want to clear staging enviornment and for that you can do
 <git reset HEAD filename>
 
 when you do <git status> command now it will show there are nothing in the staging env.
 ///////////////////////////////////////////////
 
 
 if i deleted a file form my os
 then i can get it back by doing 
 
 <git checkout -- <name of file> >
 
 ........
 
 just like any modification, deletion is also a change and we need to put it into the staging env. and then commit
 for it to become permanent
 
 //////////////////////
 
 
 Now if we use the command 
 <git rm name of file>
 
 this will delete file and push it to staging area - two things at a time
 
 
 ///////////////////////
 
 if I have made more than one changes like couple of addition,modification and deletion of files and I want to push it to staging area
 then Use command
 
 <git add --all>
