you can see every commit that you have made using git log command
<git log>

every single commit can be uniquely identified using two things
1) Commit message that you put there
2) A long hash sequence 

if we want to go back to a stage from where all future commits should not exist we can 
<git checkout <hash code f commit> >

this will detach the master branch and create anothter branch where none of the future commits exist
and you can do all normal task in the new section 

////////////////////////////////////

how to find all branches
<git branch>

the star next to the branch name is our current branch in which we are working

how to come back to master branch
<git checkout master >

/////////////////

now once back in the master branch if we want to store the alt. branch state which we were just using 
then we can use 

<git branch "give a name" hash initials >

.......................................

if i want to create a new branch 
<git branch give_a_name >

this will create a new branch but you will stay in Master branch

you can verify the creation of new branch by issuing the command
<git branch>

A very cool fact 
let's say that you want to do some tweaking into your project and see how it turns out to be
you can do that by creating a paralle branch and do changes to it and whenever feel like that you are done
you can come back to master.

same folder and files are storing different contents in different branches

if you happen to like the changes in the new branch and wants to bring it to the master branch
you can easily do that by using 

< git merge app01>
you do not need to mention the second branch name as you are already in it
